# Join the Gaire Lab

We are always interested in hearing from motivated, curious people who are excited about One Health, epidemiology, infectious diseases, microbiomes, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

---

## Graduate Students

We are actively interested in recruiting motivated, hard-working MS and PhD students who:

- Are excited about data-driven approaches to infectious disease and AMR  
- Enjoy working at the interface of field work, lab work, and computation  
- Bring new perspectives, backgrounds, and ideas to the group  

Prospective students should email Dr. Gaire with:

- A brief statement of your research interests and career goals  
- Your CV or résumé  
- Unofficial transcripts (if available)  

Please mention whether you are interested in the DVM, MS, or PhD program and your anticipated start date.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

We welcome inquiries from prospective postdoctoral fellows interested in:

- Quantitative epidemiology and mathematical modeling of AMR  
- Metagenomics, resistome/microbiome analysis, and bioinformatics  
- Translational One Health research in livestock systems  

Postdocs in the lab will be encouraged and supported to apply for extramural fellowships (e.g., NIH, USDA, foundation awards) to help build an independent research portfolio.

If you are interested, please email Dr. Gaire with:

- A cover letter describing your research experience and future directions  
- Your CV (including publications)  
- Contact information for 2–3 references

## Other Opportunities

Our lab welcomes:

- **Undergraduate students** interested in research experience in epidemiology, microbiology, or data science  
- **DVM students** seeking research exposure or short-term projects  

If you would like to explore possibilities, please send a brief email describing your interests, prior experience (if any), and approximate availability.
