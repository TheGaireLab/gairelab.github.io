# Gaire Lab Research  

The Gaire Lab studies how antimicrobial resistance (AMR), pathogens, and the microbiome interact across animal, environmental, and human domains. Our program integrates basic and applied, outcome-driven research that informs and supports animal health, food safety, and broader public health within a One Health framework.

## Research Focus

We are broadly interested in:

- **Ecology and dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in livestock production systems**  
  – How management practices, antimicrobial use, sourcing, and production environments shape AMR emergence and persistence  

- **Microbiome–pathogen interactions in disease and treatment outcomes**  
  – How the gut microbiome influences colonization, virulence, persistence of pathogens, and response to antimicrobial therapy  

- **One Health–oriented surveillance and data integration**  
  – Integrating animal, environmental, and (when relevant) human data to track AMR and zoonotic threats across the food chain  

- **Quantitative and translational approaches to AMR mitigation**  
  – Design and evaluation of microbiome- and management-based interventions to reduce AMR and improve food safety

## *What are we doing?*

Current and emerging projects in the lab include:

- **Longitudinal field studies in commercial livestock systems**  
  Tracking AMR, microbiome composition, and pathogen carriage in food animalse 

- **Resistome and microbiome profiling using high-throughput sequencing**  
  Characterizing how antimicrobial use, host factors, and production practices shape antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities.

- **One Health AMR surveillance pilots**  
  Linking fecal, environmental, and, where appropriate, downstream data to understand transmission pathways and hotspots of AMR.

- **Method development for AMR risk assessment**  
  Building and testing analytical pipelines that connect field data, sequencing outputs, and epidemiologic models to support decision-making.

## *How are we doing it?*

We use an integrated toolkit that combines:

- **Epidemiology & field-based sampling**  
  – Study design, risk factor analysis, and longitudinal sampling in animal production systems  

- **High-throughput sequencing & bioinformatics**  
  – Shotgun metagenomics, targeted sequencing, and reproducible pipelines for resistome and microbiome analysis  

- **Quantitative modeling and data science**  
  – Multilevel models, mathematical modeling, and network/One Health frameworks to understand AMR dynamics and evaluate interventions  

- **Collaborative and translational approaches**  
  – Working with veterinarians, producers, and public health partners to co-develop feasible AMR mitigation strategies and translate evidence into practice
