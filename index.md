# Welcome to the Gaire Lab
{: .display-3}

The Gaire Lab is part of the School of Veterinary Medicine at Texas Tech University, with a focus on One Health and infectious disease at the animal–human–environment interface.
{: .welcomefont}

We study how antimicrobial resistance, pathogens, and the microbiome interact in livestock and other animal populations, and how those interactions impact animal health, food safety, and public health.
{: .welcomefont}

Our lab combines field-based sampling, veterinary epidemiology, and high-throughput sequencing to generate actionable evidence that can inform veterinarians, producers, and public health partners.

We are located in the School of Veterinary Medicine building in Amarillo, Texas.

## Research Focus
We are broadly interested in:
- Ecology and dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in livestock production systems  
- Microbiome–pathogen interactions and their role in disease and treatment outcomes  
- One Health–oriented surveillance and data integration across animal, environmental, and human domains

## Training & Opportunities
The Gaire Lab is committed to mentoring DVM students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars who are excited about One Health, epidemiology, and data-driven approaches to infectious disease and AMR.
