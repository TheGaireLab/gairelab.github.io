The Gaire Lab is part of the School of Veterinary Medicine at Texas Tech University, with a focus on One Health and infectious disease at the animal–human–environment interface.

We study how antimicrobial resistance, pathogens, and the microbiome interact in livestock and other animal populations, and how those interactions impact animal health, food safety, and public health.

We are located in the School of Veterinary Medicine building in Amarillo, Texas.
